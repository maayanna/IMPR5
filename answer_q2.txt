Corrupted Function --> We want to train our network using a corrupted function that reduces the image's resolution
to find out how to solve the super-resolution problem.
In order to do that, we blur the image with the gaussian kernel who have as a size a random number between
2 and the minimum between log(width) or log(height).

Restoring image --> Once we trained well our network, we will be able to restore images using the corrupted function
we used before.
Like that, we can restore the low resolution images.
